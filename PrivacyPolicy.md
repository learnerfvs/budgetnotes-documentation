## 1. Introduction

Welcome to BudgetNotes. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data and protect your privacy when using our application. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of data protection and transparency.

**BudgetNotes is designed to be completely offline.** Your data never leaves your device except for license verification purposes.

## 2. Data We Collect

### 2.1. Data Stored Locally on Your Device

BudgetNotes stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Budget Information:** Section budgets, note budgets, expense items, and savings calculations

The only time BudgetNotes uses an internet connection is for:

**This is the ONLY network activity performed by the app.**
